Please note that images loaded from Firebase may not display properly due to an issue with Firebase storage. Firebase requires an upgrade to a paid plan to handle the image requests effectively.
Currently, due to this limitation, certain images might not appear as expected. We recommend upgrading Firebase to a paid plan for proper functionality, or alternatively, you can use local assets as placeholders.
